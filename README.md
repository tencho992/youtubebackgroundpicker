# My Youtube Background Picker
This background picker excercise allowed me to practice my skills in grabbing elements in html and adding eventListeners. This was a project created on the first day of week 4. I am emmensly proud of this work because it was my first introduction to javascript and I had so much fun with it. This was the aha moment I had been waiting for.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
This project mainly consists of learning very basic JS statements. 
Although I am proud of all my work, from tiny to impactful. This has made an great impression on my perspective on JavaScript. I am eager to learn everything JavaScript and hope to one day come close to mastering this language. 
Starting with more focused and smaller projects allowed me to embrace versatile functions and all its capabilities. In doing so, I was also able to strength my CSS skills while diving deep into focus mode on very basic fundamental functions.
